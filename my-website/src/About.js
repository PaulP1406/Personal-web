          Hello! I'm Paul Pham, a full-stack developer with a passion for technology, currently in my third year of Computer
          Science at Simon Fraser University. I have over a year of experience in the ReactJS, JS, Java, C/C++ and more! I am 
          currently looking for a co-op opportunity for the Summer 2024 term. My hobbies are software developing and 
          learning new technology every day! Outside of coding, I'm an avid F1, football and chess fan.
